#Aim: How can we use the AD_AS model to illustrate the condition of the macroeconomy?

###Short-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

- The AD-AS Model is used to analyze economic fluctuations.

- Shortages and surpluses create pressures toward equilibrium, through changing production levels and prices.

- Declines in price level are relative to the central trend.

####Keep in mind...

> For simplification this semester, focus on short-run fluctuations of the business cycles: LRAS is not shifting
In reality, all curves are generally shifting to the right (price levels going up) and perhaps up..  
Question then becomes, **how much are they shifting _relative_ to _each_ other?**  
Simplified models focus on the factors that cause shifts, etc.

###Shifts of Aggregate Demand: Short-Run Effects

**Demand and Supply Shock**

- Can go the other way around **(negative demand shock and positive supply _shock_ shown)**
