#Inflation and Monetary Policy

- increase in prices and fall in purchasing value of money
- greater demand than supply causes inflation

###Phillips Curve (SRPC)
- empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment
- A decrease in unemployment will lead to increase of disposable income
  - hiring more people will be more expensive ==> increase in personal wages ==> increase in disposable income

###Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC)
- occurs at the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemplyoment (NAIRU)
  - natural rate of unemployment (Krugman)
  - Natural rate is estimated using NAIRU

*Shifts of Phillips Curve*
- Shifts in SRAS/LRAS will cause respective shifts
- SRAS and SRPC are mirror images of each other (one shifts left, other shifts right)

###Fiscal Policy vs. Monetary Policy
*Fiscal Policy*: Changing government spending and taxation
*Monetary Policy*: affected by _policy interest rate_: banking "discounts"

>Fed cannot influence interest rates for households

Central banks use changes in policy interest rate as "currency" to change monetary policy

###Quantitative Easing

- new monetary policy used to combat deep recessions
- banks did _not_ have liquid assets during the Great Depression (people rushed to banks to take out money)
- method in which central bank bought bonds, but also longer-term assets (mortgage-backed securities)

*Warning*: quantitative easing forced central bank to purchase _toxic_ assets

###Fiscal or Monetary Policy?

- Monetary policy is used for small and quick fluctuations in the economy
  - Can be quickly enacted by the "Fed"

- Fiscal Policy used for deeper slumps in the economy
	- deeper recessions and huge expansions also need to boost confidence of consumers

###Exchange Rate Channel of Monetary Policy
- Australian Reserve Bank cut interests rates ==> depreciation of dollar

###Demand Shock vs. Monetary Policy
- *Demand Shock*: An unexpected change in aggregate demand
- tech bubble popped in 90s, GDP went from 4.9% to .9%

###Supply Shock vs. Monetary Policy

*Supply Shock* - Unexpected shift of aggregate supply
Demand shocks result in movements along the Phillips Curve, supply shocks shift the curve

- Negative supply shocks (higher oil prices) result in stagflation, higher unemployment *AND* higher inflation
- Positive supply shocks, such as advancement in technology, result in downward/rightward shift in supply curve
