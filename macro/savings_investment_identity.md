#Aim: Saving and Investment

###The Savings_Investment Spending Identity

Must distinguish between `Total Saving` and `Total Wealth`
- "flow variable" being total _saving_
  - think back to bathtub analogy

Wealth can be *Financial Assets* or *Physical Assets*
- _Financial Asset_
  - market shares, checks, etc.
- _Physical Asset_
  - cars, houses, or "physical goods"

###Three Tasks of a Financial System

####A Well-Functioning Financial System

#####Reducing Transaction Costs
- amount of time needed to find suitable transactions == transaction cost
- trustworthy exchange

#####Reducing Risk
- Diversification of loan portfolios
  - lower risk if debtor defaults, can still be insured
  - can also have a "diversified stock portfolio", in case one company tanks, still a net profit
  
#####Providing Liquidity

"Liquid asset" is a most fluid asset, able to be immmediately spent: cash
"Illiquid asset" is a least fluid asset, not as able to be liquidated: car, house

Is a spectrum:

| Liquid | Intermediate | Illiquid |
|:------:|:------------:|:--------:|
| Cash | Money Transfer, Stocks/Shares | Physical Goods (cars, houses) |
| Greater access and spending potential | | Greater profit efficiency and potential |

Financial intermediaries provides a solid intermediary, able to have liquidity as well as a balanced, efficient profit

Financial systems help with development, but individual consumers/firms still need to actively invest, instead of just taking "microloans" for consumer spending

##### Types of Financial Assets

- _Loans_
- _Bonds_
  - Default risk: higher the risk, higher the interest rate
  - Loan-backed Securities (Collaterialized Debt Obligation - CDO):
	- *advantages*: aggregate "insurance", lower risk of total default
	- *disadvantages*: major overestimation of "safety" of bundling loans
		- risk should be reduced, but people got too overconfident
		- "can't fail loans", definitely `x` rate of return, but large macroeconomic event could cause large amounts of people to default (`inflation`)
		- regarded all _"medium risks"_ as _"low risk"_ due to large-scale bundling, investing as a "low-risk" bundle, rather than a mixed risk portfolio
	  - _*speculation*_
		- part of these *securities* were based on housing asset price bubble
		  - even if people can't pay their mortgage, for example, the house would still rise in value
		  - everyone was making decisions based on false housing _*speculations*_
- _Stocks_
  - Owning a share of a company

>The desire of individuals to reduce their total risk by engaging in diversification is why we have stocks and and a stock market (also to make larger investments possible, e.g. B.E.I.C.)
