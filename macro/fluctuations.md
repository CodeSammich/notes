#Economic Fluctuations and Unemployment

###How do households cope with fluctuation?

- Save during recession, spend during expansion

###Consumption-Smoothing Model

- People try to account for different shocks in the economy by "smoothing" out their spending patterns
- Whether temporary or permanent change in the economy

##### Limitations
- A lot of people aren't able to smooth out their curve
  - People don't know everything about economic shock
  - Can't predict future, saving patterns and such
  - Can't get loans, or not good enough job to get the money they need

- Wealthier familes can borrow more to smooth out consumption functions

**Effects of Negative shock**
- Some families will immmediately prepare for lowered income
  - Other families will anticipate negative shock
    - will be hit a lot harder because no savings
    - lack of prediction
	- more success at smoothing = more stability

- Firms will invest in the opposite manner
  - Opportunity helps firms do large amounts of aggregate investment

- **Push Investment**
   - Part of a "tech bubble"
   - Don't want to be left behind, updating production

- **Pull Investment**
 - Firms can get stuck in a "vicious cycle"
   - Have low expectations of growth, so low capacity utilization
   - Spending less = less payout to workers
 - Firms can also go into a "virtuous cycle"
   - Government spending can incentivize spending
   - "Game Theory" focuses on group spending to be advantageous to both groups
 - Binary decision of investment
  - **Nash Equilibium**    
    - Nobody should make a different decision = overall success of group

###Volatility

- GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
  - Net Exports would be more volatile

Calculation of Percent Change in GDP = Average of all four components

###Unemployment - Okun's Law
- there exists **linear inverse relationship** between the GPD and unemployment
 - empirical law

> ""For every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, a country's GDP will be at an additional roughly 2% lower than its potential GDP."

- Linear progression is largely disputed due to accuracy in modern economies
 - However, good prediction for general trend
 - Accurate in trend, but the unemployment measurement is not necessarily always as linear as Okun's Law suggests, but still accounts for a good part of unemployment

###Philip's Curve

- Inverse relatinoship between inflation and unemployment __in the short term__
