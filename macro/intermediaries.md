#Aim: What economic functions are performed by financial intermediaries?

###Is there a Savings = Investment Spending Identity?

Remember: Investment is defined as the addition of physical capital

By definition, total income = total spending

If assume no government and no trade, then:

>Total income = Consumption + Saving
      and
Total spending = Consumption + Investment

Therefore, saving = investment:
	- But apparant implication is saving = better economy

###The Savings - Investment Spending Identity

>Caution! This is an identity, not an explained causal relationship. Do higher savings cause higher levels of investment? Or is it the opposite (as Keynes argued)?

Now, more complexity:

- What difference does a (_government_) Budget Surplus or Budget Deficit make?
  - annualized and including transfers as well as spending in "G" variable
- What is the difference between National Savings and Private Savings?
  - National = private + public savings
- What difference does a net (financial) Capital Inflow make?
  - Inflow: Foreign savers are going to put their savings into the U.S. (for example)
  - Outflow: Domestic savers save to foreign

Government debt is mostly issued to government **bonds**: basically a transfer of money from one person to another in the form of bonds
