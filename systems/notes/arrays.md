#Aim: What's the point of it all?

##Memory Management  
 * Memory allocation either happens at compile time or at run time (dynamic).

##Compiler Allocated Memory  
 * Packaged with the binary of the program

  * There is no standard default value

   * Variables and arrays are allocated here
    * ex. float a,	  int b[5]  

##Arrays
 * Are not dynamic

  * Must have a fixed size

   * There is no length function

   * There is no boundary checking
