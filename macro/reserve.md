#The Reserve Requirement

###Bank-Bank Interest Rates (Fed)
*required reserve ratio* - how much banks are reqiured federally (% of deposits) to save
*reserve requirement* - number of $ (different amounts of deposits)

*Federal Funds Market*?
- market for borrowing money for banks to "cover" their reserve requirement

*The Federal Funds Rate* (_FFR_)
- rate at which banks are willing to charge each other for federal funds market loans

*The Discount Rate*
- higher the discount rate, less likely to lend to other banks
- the minimum Federal Funds Rate interest rate set by the Federal Reserve for lending to other banks

FFR - Fed targets bank interest rate to affect customer borrowing attitude of macroeconomy

###Open-Market Operations

*Federal Reserve*

- *Central Bank of U.S*
  - Directed by board of governors
  - 12 federal reserve banks
  - trying to shift aggregate demand curve to suit needs
  - members are chosen by president, and approved by congress, but can serve up to 14 year terms
- *function of federal reserve system*
  - provides financial service to financial intermediaries
  - supervises and regulates banking institutions
  - maintains the stability of financial system
  - conducts monetary policy

|Assets | Liabilities |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
|government debt (treasury bills) | monetary base (currency in circulation + bank reserves) < doesn't really mean anything anymore |

- what are the three major tools of federal reserve system for influencing the money supply
- what would the fed do with each tool to increase the money supply? (least to most important)
  - *reserve requirement*
	- effects how much money a bank can have. done very rarely, because it has  dramatic affect.
	- *increase*: decreases excess reserves forced to reduce lending, money supply decreases
	- *decrease*: increases excess reserves can allow for more loans to be lent out, increases money supply
  - *discount rate*
	- rate at which banks borrow money from Fed (when banks don't have reserves, will borrow from each other, but eventually from the fed. Almost like a penalty for not meeting min reserve requirement)
	- *decrease*: lending increases, money supply increases
	- *increase*: lending falls, money supply decreases
  - *open market operations*
	  - buying and selling of government bonds. The same ones that the government sells
	  - increase:
	  - decrease:

*Money Multiplier*

money multiplier = 1 / rr = 1 / (reserves / checkable deposits) = _checkable deposits / reserves_

> checkable deposits / reserves
