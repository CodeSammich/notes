#Aim: Who cares about public debt?

T > G + Transfers, then surplus
T < G + Transfers, then deficit

Are deficits or surpluses good or bad?

`S_gov = T - (G + Transfers)`

Expansionary policies reduce budget balance
Contractionary policies increase budget balance

A dollar of G has greater impact on AD than a dollar of T

###The Business Cycle and Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance

If budget balance = 0; gov't is collecting same taxes to budget
If > 0; surplus == more taxes/revenue than budget spending
If < 0; deficit, etc.
