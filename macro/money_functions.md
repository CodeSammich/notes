#Aim: What are the functions of money?

###What is money?

Narrowest definition of money: M1 (*the money supply*, includes M0)
- Curency in Circulation (M0)
- Checkable Bank Deposits ("demand deposits")
- "universal commodity"
  - Not appreciate as fast

- Savings and Small Time Deposits, and money market shares (M2, includes M1)
- Not liquid
- Savings
- Greater effiency of growth

Tradeoff between liquidity and growth (interest)

###Advantages over barter system:

- doesn't need equivalent ""double necessity" or "coincidence of wants", but money has universal time
- "universal commodity" ==> universally accepted
- precise value of goods and services

Commodity Money - physical goods
Commodity-backed Money - paper that *represented x amounts of gold*, etc.
Fiat Money - easily produced "commodity-backed money", like paper money + credit, not necessarily representing physical goods > gold > cows
