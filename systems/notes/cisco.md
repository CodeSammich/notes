###OSI 7-Layer Model

Used to help conceptualize the different parks of network connections.

The top layer is the most concrete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code).

*The Layers*:
 1. Physical
 2. Data Link
 3. Network
 4. Transport
 5. Session
 6. Presentation
 7. Application
 
If you are working on a particular layer, you should not have to think too much about the other layers.

_Physical Layer_

How computesr are physically connected

Things like electrons running across wires, radio signals pulsing through the air...
