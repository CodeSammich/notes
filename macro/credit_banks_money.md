#Credit, Banks, and Money

###Time and Trust

- Borrowing and lending money are only made possible through trust and "passage of time"
- Trust is a major factor in making money work (credit, checks, banknotes, etc.)
  - _Irish Bank Closure_
	- lasted six and a half months, but people going to the pubs still used bank notes, because they knew each other and had trust

###Wealth and Income

- **Wealth**
  - Saved money over periods of time
- **Income**
  - Flow of money, and this "hourly wage"
  - _bathtub analogy_
	- income = showerhead
	- wealth = water already in the tub
	- consumption = water flowing out

###Borrowing and Lending

Borrowing and lending allows individuals to rearrange purchasing capacity in time
If you borrow, you can buy more now, but less later

> People would rather have "some now and some later" then "none now and all later"

- Can have different kinds of "indifference curves" (where she'll be happy)
  - higher kinds of utilities ==> "happiness", but still content regardless
  - higher utlity = more preferable, but she'll still be happy with any kind of indifference curve

###Status Quo Indifference Curves

Marco has $100 now vs. Julia's "future" $100

Can consume more now and less later or can "invest" and yield greater amounts later: both count as "consuming" more now

##### Risks in Lending

Unanticipated events might affect ability of borrowers to pay back

_Equity_ : Borrower's own wealth invested in the project

_Collateral_: property set aside to be transferred to the lender if the loan is not repaid (Ex. Housing loans)

**As a result:**

1. the borrow has a greater interest in making sure the project succeeds
2. higher success rate

##### Loans Conditions for Borrowers with Little Wealth

- Amount requested for borrwing is small and can be covered by limited collateral
- Money is offered at a higher interest rate to obtain loan back

#####Banks and Money

_Bank_: a firm that
_maturity transformation_: amount you borrow can allow banks to invest your money

**Default Risk**: possibility that loans will not be repaid
**Bank Run**: depositors decide to withdraw all money instantaneously. Liquidity risk can cause bank failures
**Commercial banks** borrow from the money market where the cost of borrowing is controlled by the Central Bank

**Federal Deposite Insurance Company** (FDIC): _**PRIVATE**_ insurance organization that pays out a bank that the banks all "pitch in" beforehand, as insurance

A bank is a firm that seeks to make profit just as most firms do, by investing in successful projects and lending to people who will be able to repay debt with interest

**Assets** - what banks owns or what is owed to it
**Liabilities**- What the bank owes and what it is responsible for

`Equity = Assets - Liabilities`

##### The Central Bank

"the bank of banks": commercial banks can borrow or deposit from "Central Bank"
- Holds a monopoly on legal tender: used to stabilize economy
