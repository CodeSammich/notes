#Inflation and Monetary Policy

- increase in prices and fall in purchasing value of money
- greater demand than supply causes inflation

###Phillips Curve (SRPC)
- empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment
- A decrease in unemployment will lead to increase of disposable income
  - hiring more people will be more expensive ==> increase in personal wages ==> increase in disposable income

###Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC)
- occurs at the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemplyoment (NAIRU)
  - natural rate of unemployment (Krugman)
  - Natural rate is estimated using NAIRU

*Shifts of Phillips Curve*
- Shifts in SRAS/LRAS will cause respective shifts
- SRAS and SRPC are mirror images of each other (one shifts left, other shifts right)

###Fiscal Policy vs. Monetary Policy
*Fiscal Policy*: Changing government spending and taxation
*Monetary Policy*: affected by _policy interest rate_: banking "discounts"

>Fed cannot influence interest rates for households

Central banks use changes in policy interest rate as "currency" to change monetary policy

###Quantitative Easing

- new monetary policy used to combat deep recessions
- banks did _not_ have liquid assets during the Great Depression (people rushed to banks to take out money)
- method in which central bank bought bonds, but also longer-term assets (mortgage-backed securities)

*Warning*: quantitative easing forced central bank to purchase _toxic_ assets

###Fiscal or Monetary Policy?

- Monetary policy is used for small and quick fluctuations in the economy
  - Can be quickly enacted by the "Fed"

- Fiscal Policy used for deeper slumps in the economy
	- deeper recessions and huge expansions also need to boost confidence of consumers

###Exchange Rate Channel of Monetary Policy
- Australian Reserve Bank cut interests rates ==> depreciation of dollar

###Demand Shock vs. Monetary Policy
- *Demand Shock*: An unexpected change in aggregate demand
- tech bubble popped in 90s, GDP went from 4.9% to .9%

###Supply Shock vs. Monetary Policy

*Supply Shock* - Unexpected shift of aggregate supply
Demand shocks result in movements along the Phillips Curve, supply shocks shift the curve

- Negative supply shocks (higher oil prices) result in stagflation, higher unemployment *AND* higher inflation
- Positive supply shocks, such as advancement in technology, result in downward/rightward shift in supply curve

#####Policy Indifference Curves
- How politicians prioritize affects
  - prioritizing inflation/unemployment/etc. depends on politician "indifference" to other issues

###Inflation Averse & Unemployment Averse
- Phillips curve is unstable when unemployment rates are extreme

1. People will base their actions on expectations of future reality
2. People will treat present price levels as messages about what will happen in the future

> If unemployment is too low, people will think they have more _bargaining power_ than they actually do
This is called a *bargaining gap*: bargaining power is _inflated_
If unemployment is super high, inflation expectations will go down and bargaining gaps will fall

There _is_ a *Stable Rate of Unemployment*
- *Target Rate of Inflation* tries to keep the economy stable
  - governments will be basing monetary policies to keep unemployment, etc. stable

#Aim: How can we model the causes of inflation?

###The Classical Model of Money and Prices

Inflation = price level increasing:

 - Output going up: demand going up
 - Output going down: SRAS going down

 At Actual Output == Potential Output, then Actual umeployment ==  Natural Rate of Unemployment 
 Actual < Natural if actual > potential
