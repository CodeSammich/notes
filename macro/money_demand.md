#The Money Demand Curve

- Buyers use money to demand the product
- Inverse relationship between nominal interest rate and quantity of money *demanded*
  - convenience factor of holding money, liquid form is easily consumable
  - "quantity of money" being quantity of liquid money demanded
	- *money* assumes "liquid money" (M1)

###Shifts of the Money Demand Curve
![Demand Curve Money Shift] (http://members.shaw.ca/elementaleconomics/images/P&B/Ch.%2027/Fig.%2027.5%20Change%20Money%20Demand.jpg)

Increase in _*nominal*_ GDP in increases "transactions demand" for money (to use as a medium of exchange)

*Change in:*
- *Price Level*
  - If higher price level: more money needed to spend day to day necessities
- *Real GDP*
  - More product is being produced and sold, people on the whole will have more "stuff", and will need more liquid money to go about their daily lives
- *Technology*
  - Easier to access liquid money (ATM Machine)
  - Credit cards, etc.
- *Institutions (Regulations)*

###Equilibrium Interest Rate
Liquidity Preference Model of the Interest Rate

######MONEY MARKET

Fed can control money supply, so vertical curve
Completely *independent* of the interest rate

Fed sells bonds at lower prices, increases supply of bonds if there is a high quantity of money

###Two Models of the Interest Rate

#Aim: How are the suply and demand of loanable funds determined?

###Loanable Funds

#####The Market for Loanable Funds
Use real interest rate for market for loanable funds
Nobody really cares about nominal interest rate

"Crowding out": too little investment funds to loan to businesses

*Affect Loanable Funds Supply/Demand Curve*
1. There is an increase in capital inflows: supply curve shift right (more loanable funds, capital actually means money this time)
2. Businesses are pessimistic about future business conditions: shift demand curve left
3. The government increases borrowing: demand increases, shifts right
4. The private savings rate decreases: demand curve shifts right

###Inflation and Interest Rates
>Real Interest = Nominal Interest - Inflation

`r% = i% - (pi)%`

*The Fisher Effect*
- expected real interest is unaffected by changes in expected inflation
- because those expectations shift supply left and demand right

`Nominal Interest = Expect Real Interest + Expected Inflation`

`i% = exp. r% + exp. pi(%)`

_Implication_: the loanable funds market (in real terms) is not affected by changes in expected inflation
