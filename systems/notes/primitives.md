#Aim: Time to C what we can do.

###Do Now: What command line programs would do the following: (always assume you are starting at your home directory)

1. Move foo.java from Desktop/ to Documents/
2. Remove all .class files (* = wild card, asterisk)
3. Connect to lisa.study.edu from someplace else
4. Figure out what gcc does
5. Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/ directory on homer (assume you are not working on homer itself)

#Aim: C what I did there?

	     scp woohoo.c dw@homer.stuy.edu:/code/

	     scp <file>   <server>:<path>

			  {Destination}	{Remote directory, default home}

- Secure copy works both ways: home => remote, remote => home (download)
