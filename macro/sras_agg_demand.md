#Macroeconomic Equilibrium

##Aim: How can we use the AD_AS model to illustrate the condition of the macroeconomy?

###Short-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

- The AD-AS Model is used to analyze economic fluctuations.

- Shortages and surpluses create pressures toward equilibrium, through changing production levels and prices.

- Declines in price level are relative to the central trend.

####Keep in mind...

> For simplification this semester, focus on short-run fluctuations of the business cycles: LRAS is not shifting
In reality, all curves are generally shifting to the right (price levels going up) and perhaps up..  
Question then becomes, **how much are they shifting _relative_ to _each_ other?**  
Simplified models focus on the factors that cause shifts, etc.

###Shifts of Aggregate Demand and SRAS: Short-Run Effects

**Demand and Supply Shock**

![Demand And Supply Shock] (http://worthwhile.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451688169e201157046d379970b-pi)

- Can go the other way around **(negative demand shock and positive supply _shock_ shown)**

| Negative Supply Shock | Positive Supply Shock |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| leads to stagflation - stagnating productivity with inflating prices | higher output and less upward pressure on prices |

> Late 90s expansion: low unemployment without much inflation
Positive supply shock, but measuring hourly productivity is difficult for salaried employees
More hours or more production per hour? Wages was stuck, and accounted for by defeat of labor movement --SRAS didn't shift much

#####Income
- wages + salaries
- property income
 - profit
 - interest
 - rent

####Questions

Describe the short-run effects of each of the following shocks on the aggregate price level and on aggregate output.

1. The government sharply increases the minimum wage, raising the wages of many works.
2. Solar energy firms launch a major program of investment spending
3. Congress raises taxes and cuts spending
4. Severe weather destroys crop around the world.

####Long-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

**Recessionary Gap**
- Caused by negative demand shock
- How can we identify the size of the output gap?
- Will it self-correct? ==> Overinvestment to _Nash Equilibrium_

**Exchange Rate**
- If a currency has _appreciated_: the price of the other currency went down
  - The same one dollar can buy _more_ of the other currency
- If a currency has _depreciated_: the price of the other currency went up
  - The same one dollar can buy _less_ of the other currency  
- "Neoclassical Synthesis"
  - Two extremes of the importance of short-run vs. long-run
  - Boils down to _"How long is the self-correction going to take?"_

> &Delta;initial spending * multiplier = &Delta; total spending
multiplier = 1 / (MPS) 

####Policy Responses to Demand Shocks

####Lags in Fiscal Policy
- Recognition lag
- Decision lag
- Implementation lag
- Why do lags make fiscal policy decisions more difficult?
